For instructions on green v1 boards see the [v1 tag](https://github.com/lukewakeford/DSLSwitchMod/tree/1.0)

You can get a v2.0 board [on eBay](https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/134222632940)

# DSL Switch Mod v2.0
Adding a tactile switch in place of the stylus holder on your DS Lite / GB Macro.

For v2.0 I wanted to make the installation of the breakout board solderless, to that end I've added a flex connector that picks up P10, P11, P12 and GND from the top screen connector.

note: you can still solder these connections if you want/need to.

# To use this mod
You need to flash your ds lite with the tv out firmware mod *or* [buy a preflashed module](https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/134222632940) - I recommend following [facelesstech's guide](https://bit.ly/3Nf0MW5) as he has gathered the most relevant information in one place. (the [bit.ly link](https://bit.ly/3Nf0MW5) on the board links to this guide)

If you buy a preflashed module you simply need to swap old for new, unplug the old module from the back of our DS Lite's motherboard and plug in the new.
