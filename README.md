# To use this mod
You need to flash your ds lite with the tv out firmware mod *or* [buy a preflashed module](https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/134222632940) - I recommend following [facelesstech's guide](https://bit.ly/3Nf0MW5) as he has gathered the most relevant information in one place. (the [bit.ly link](https://bit.ly/3Nf0MW5) on the board links to this guide)

If you buy a preflashed module you simply need to swap old for new, unplug the old module from the back of our DS Lite's motherboard and plug in the new.

# Install Tips
- The 3D printed button cap can be simply pushed in to place from the inside of the case, sometimes it may be required to shave a small amount of plastic away where the cap meets the tact switch to adjust the clicky-ness. [v1.0 video example](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/EsnwIeIT36A)
- Use two of the original stylus tray screws (ones with the slight gold tint) to secure the breakout board in place. [v1.0 video example](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/EsnwIeIT36A)
- If soldering follow this pin out, I found that running wires underneath the ds game card slot is a good route for this.

- Please see the pictures at the top of this readme for the correct location to install the flex cable in the top screen connector port.
- If installing solderless you will need to allow the flex cable to fold somewhere underneath the battery. 
- Due to only using ~half of the top screen port it is possible to missalign the flex cable and the swtiches won't work - if this is the case - try again but ensure the flex cable is as far as it can go in to the port and to the right of the port.
